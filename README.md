# Robotics Project
This is a robot project in our class CS4540.

## Setting up Rasberry Pi
### You will need
1. Rasberry Pi 3 or Rasberry Pi 4
2. Micro-sd card with atleast 32 Gb
3. `Balena-Etcher` which is a program for writing software images to usb drives. [Download Link](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)

### Set up SD Card with Ubuntu Mate
1. Go to `https://ubuntu-mate.org/raspberry-pi/download/`
2. Download the `arm64` version.
3. Write the software image you just downloaded on to the micro-sd card with `Balena- Etcher`
4. Insert micro sd into the Rasberry Pi.

### Initalizing the Rasberry Pi
#### Init
1. Start the Rasberry Pi
2. Go through the system configuration and setup

#### Stop automatic upgrades
We don't want automatic upgrades to run without warning, so we will disable this in this step.
Run the command 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow unattended-upgrades' in your terminal. 

#### Set-up Wifi
Just use the Mate desktop Network Manager for this

#### Configure Ubuntu- Mate to start in a terminal
This step is so the Rasberry Pi starts in a terminal window instead of the Desktop Environment.

Run the following commands in your terminal:
1. `sudo systemctl enable multi-user.target --force`
2. `sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target`
3. `sudo reboot` This will reboot the system
4. `After the system is rebooted run `sudo apt install xinit`
5. Now if you want to run the desktop environment you can use the command `startx`.
6. Run `sudo reboot` again to make sure all the changes are installed

#### Get rid of some Ubuntu bloat
Removing some stuff we don't need to free up space.
1. `snap list`
2. `sudo snap remove software-boutique`
3. `sudo snap remove ubuntu-mate-pi`
4. `sudo snap remove ubuntu-mate-welcome`
5. `sudo su`
6. `sudo snap remove snapd`
7. `sudo systemctl stop snapd.service`
8. `sudo apt update`
9. `sudo apt remove snapd --purge`
10. `sudo apt autoremove`

#### Upgrading Ubuntu
This can take up to an hour.

Best to do this from the startup terminal

1. `sudo apt update`
2. `sudo apt upgrade`

#### Adding Python Extras
Python3 sould already be installed, we just need to add some python3 extras

`sudo apt install python3-pip`
`sudo apt install python3-dev`
`sudo apt install idle3`

#### Install ROS2 Foxy Fitzroy
Download and install ROS2 Foxy Fitzroy
